# hash
Collection of hash functions which i implemented by myself following the corresponding white papers. Most of them will be for educational purpose, since those algorithms have already been heavily optimized by other people (where in many cases some shortcuts have been found - so those even differ from the formal description). I'm also hoping to provide implementations for algorithms that have not been implemented in Go yet (well, at least not published)
